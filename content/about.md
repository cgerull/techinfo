description: Some words about this personal site.

I maintain this site as place to store cheat sheets, procedures and descriptions. Some of them I use so seldom that it's not worthwhile to memorize them. Other's are instructions I use for customers and are interesting enough to share. In short, you can read this site as an itinerary of my travels through Information Technology.

Publishing them all in a public place will help others too.

## Myself

Living and working in the Netherlands, I'm in the IT over 30 years now. Currently my position is senior engineer for Kubernetes and containerized services. In the past I was involved with many aspects from technical enginering to development.

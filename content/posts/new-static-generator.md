Here we go.

Today I start testing "[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)", a new static site generator written in go. Or better <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank">Hugo</a>.

Every now and them I need something new to play with. As Jekyll is the most 
established generator it is also the slowest. The progress of new development
is also not very speedy.<!--more-->

For my kubernetes / docker / ansible background I'm quite familiar with go templates,
this will make working with Hugo more fun. At least that's my idea.

We will see what the future will bring.
